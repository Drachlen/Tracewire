Bomb defusing game made for Ludum Dare 27

This is a project that was made for Ludum Dare 27. Ludum Dare is an online community best known for “Ludum Dare”, the Accelerated Game Development Event of the same name (also called a “Game Jam”). During a Ludum Dare, developers from around the world spend a weekend creating games based on a theme suggested by the community. Ludum Dare events take place every April, August and December.

Ludum Dare 27 took place on Aguust 23rd-26th, 2013 with a theme of "10 Seconds."

Tracewire is a game about defusing bombs before the timer runs out.
Your goal is to trace along the wires as quickly as possible.
You have 10 seconds to trace out each wire.

Overall the project took about 8 hours.

CONTROLS: 
Arrow keys to trace along a wire. Spacebar to clear gold nodes. 

Level Editor:
The game includes a built in level editor.
To access the editor, press the "`" (tilde) key. This will toggle between the game and the editor.
Every wire must have a starting node at the far left (0) position, and a finishing node at the far right (14) position.
Double clicking the most recent node will toggle between a regular or gold node.
