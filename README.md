Bomb defusing game made for Ludum Dare 27

This is a project that was made for Ludum Dare 27. Ludum Dare is an online community best known for “Ludum Dare”, the Accelerated Game Development Event of the same name (also called a “Game Jam”). During a Ludum Dare, developers from around the world spend a weekend creating games based on a theme suggested by the community. Ludum Dare events take place every April, August and December.

Tracewire is a game about defusing bombs before the timer runs out.
Your goal is to trace along the wires as quickly as possible.
You have 10 seconds to trace out each wire.
